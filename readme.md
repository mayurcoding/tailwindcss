# Tailwind CSS

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. 

## Key Features
- **Utility-First**: Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of utility classes that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind includes responsive variants for every utility, making it easy to build responsive interfaces.
- **Customization**: Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing you to configure your design system and generate utility classes based on your needs.
- **Performance**: Tailwind's approach to CSS ensures that you only ship the styles you need, resulting in smaller CSS files and better performance.

## Box Properties
Tailwind CSS provides several utility classes to control the box properties of elements, such as padding, margin, border, and shadow.

### Padding
Use the `p-{size}` class to add padding to all sides of an element. For example:
```html
<div class="p-4">Padding on all sides</div>
```
You can also specify padding for individual sides using `pt-{size}`, `pr-{size}`, `pb-{size}`, and `pl-{size}`.

### Margin
Use the `m-{size}` class to add margin to all sides of an element. For example:
```html
<div class="m-4">Margin on all sides</div>
```
You can also specify margin for individual sides using `mt-{size}`, `mr-{size}`, `mb-{size}`, and `ml-{size}`.

### Border
Use the `border` class to add a border to an element. You can control the width, color, and radius of the border using additional classes like `border-2`, `border-red-500`, and `rounded-lg`.

### Shadow
Use the `shadow` class to add a box shadow to an element. Tailwind provides several shadow utilities like `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md`, and `shadow-lg` to control the intensity of the shadow.

## Installation
To install Tailwind CSS, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

## Usage
To use Tailwind CSS in your project, include it in your CSS file:

```css

Then, you can start using the utility classes in your HTML:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
    Hello, Tailwind CSS!
</div>
```

## Typography
Tailwind CSS provides a variety of utility classes to control the typography of your elements, such as font size, font weight, line height, and text color.

### Font Size
Use the `text-{size}` class to set the font size of an element. For example:
```html
<div class="text-lg">Large Text</div>
```

### Font Weight
Use the `font-{weight}` class to set the font weight of an element. For example:
```html
<div class="font-bold">Bold Text</div>
```

### Line Height
Use the `leading-{size}` class to set the line height of an element. For example:
```html
<div class="leading-loose">Loose Line Height</div>
```

### Text Color
Use the `text-{color}` class to set the text color of an element. For example:
```html
<div class="text-red-500">Red Text</div>
```

### Text Alignment
Use the `text-{alignment}` class to set the text alignment of an element. For example:
```html
<div class="text-center">Centered Text</div>
```

### Text Decoration
Use the `underline`, `line-through`, or `no-underline` classes to control text decoration. For example:
```html
<div class="underline">Underlined Text</div>
```

### Text Transform
Use the `uppercase`, `lowercase`, or `capitalize` classes to control text transformation. For example:
```html
<div class="uppercase">Uppercase Text</div>
## Pseudo-Classes
Tailwind CSS provides utilities for styling elements based on their state using pseudo-classes. These include hover, focus, active, and more.

### Hover
Use the `hover:` prefix to apply styles when an element is hovered. For example:
```html
<div class="hover:bg-blue-500">Hover me</div>
```

### Focus
Use the `focus:` prefix to apply styles when an element is focused. For example:
```html
<input class="focus:border-blue-500" type="text" placeholder="Focus me">
```

### Active
Use the `active:` prefix to apply styles when an element is active. For example:
```html
<button class="active:bg-blue-700">Active Button</button>
```

### Group Hover
Use the `group-hover:` prefix to apply styles to child elements when a parent with the `group` class is hovered. For example:
```html
<div class="group">
    <div class="group-hover:text-blue-500">Hover the parent</div>
</div>
```

### Focus Within
Use the `focus-within:` prefix to apply styles to an element when any child element has focus. For example:
```html
<div class="focus-within:bg-blue-100">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Focus within me">
</div>
```

### Disabled
Use the `disabled:` prefix to apply styles to disabled elements. For example:
```html
<button class="disabled:opacity-50" disabled>Disabled Button</button>
```
