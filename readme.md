# Tailwind CSS

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. 

## Key Features
- **Utility-First**: Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of utility classes that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind includes responsive variants for every utility, making it easy to build responsive interfaces.
- **Customization**: Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing you to configure your design system and generate utility classes based on your needs.
- **Performance**: Tailwind's approach to CSS ensures that you only ship the styles you need, resulting in smaller CSS files and better performance.

## Installation
To install Tailwind CSS, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

## Usage
To use Tailwind CSS in your project, include it in your CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then, you can start using the utility classes in your HTML:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
    Hello, Tailwind CSS!
</div>
```
